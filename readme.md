# pocket-exporter

pocket-exporter is a command-line tool written in Go that exports your Pocket archive to file. It retrieves your saved items from Pocket and saves them in a structured JSON format, sorted by the time they were added.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use pocket-exporter, you need to:

1. Obtain Pocket API credentials (Consumer Key and Access Token)

By default it uses `78809-9423d8c743a58f62b23ee85c` as the consumer key.
This seems to be the hardcoded key Pocket uses for their web app. Itâ€™s public and shared between all users, so there is no problem with sharing it here.


## Installation

### Option 1: Download pre-built binary (recommended)

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/crhuber/pocket-exporter/releases) page of this repository.
2. Download the latest release for your operating system:

   - For macOS: `pocket-exporter-darwin-amd64`
   - For Linux: `pocket-exporter-linux-amd64`

3. (Optional) Rename the downloaded file to `pocket-exporter` or easier use.
4. Make the file executable (macOS and Linux only):

`chmod +x pocket-exporter`


## Usage
Run the tool using the following command:

`./pocket-exporter [--file filename.json]`

Options:

```
   --file value, -f value          file name to export (default: "pocket-export.json")
   --access_token value, -t value  Pocket API access token [$POCKET_ACCESS_TOKEN]
   --consumer_key value, -k value  Pocket API consumer key (default: "78809-9423d8c743a58f62b23ee85c") [$POCKET_CONSUMER_KEY]
   --output value, -o value        Output format (json,txt,csv)
   --state value, -s value         Return only these (all,archive,unread) (default: "all")
```

Example:

`./pocket-exporter --file my_pocket_items.json`

This will create a file named my_pocket_items.json in the current directory, containing your Pocket items sorted by the time they were added (newest first).

## Output Format
The output JSON file contains an array of Pocket items, each with the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "resolved_title": "Article Title",
    "resolved_url": "https://example.com/article",
    "time_added": 1593561600,
    "time_read": 1593561601
  }
]
```

The output in text format contains a pocket item on each new line, each with the following structure:

```
2024-01-01T00:00:00+00:00	Article Title	https://example.com/article
```

The output in csv format contains a pocket item on each new line, each with the following structure:
```
time_added,time_read,resolved_title,resolved_url
1723320229,172330230,Article Title,https://example.com/article
```

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues:

1. Ensure your Pocket API credentials are correct
2. Check your internet connection
3. Verify that you have the necessary permissions to write to the output file location
